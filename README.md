# **Effective Robotic Cleaning:** Wall-Following with JPS Pathfinding

## Objectives

Our main goal is to optimize the coverage area of traditional vacuuming robots. We do so by combining a wall-following algorithm with Jump Point Search that allows for total room coverage.

## Getting Started

To run code unzip and launch create3.py then launch Lidar.py. To view JPS and A* examples simply run the JPS and A* python files. Implimentation of the JPS and A* algorithms using the robot was impossible given the resources available.
