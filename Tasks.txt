Rob:
    - implement IR code to detect closer obstacles without lidar
      (more accurate than lidar at detecting close obstacles)

    - Improve wall following by adding smoothing or allowing the wall following algorithm to adjust to
    the actual distance it is away from the wall rather than just detecting a specific distance



Erick:

    - Finish writing A* algorithm for pathfinding comparison demonstrations

    - Finish writing JPS+ for main algo

    - try an implement my code in Gazebo so we don't have to actually show the real robot at the
    conference

    - Review code Rob uploads, make comments
