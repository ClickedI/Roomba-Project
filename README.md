# Roomba-Project
CSC212 Roomba project


Group Project for CSC212 w/ Rob

It uses a JPS algorithm along with wall following to navigate and clean a room efficiently. 


To run code unzip and launch create3.py then launch Lidar.py. To view JPS and A* examples simply run the JPS and A* python files. Implimentation of the JPS and A* algorithms using the robot was impossible given the resources available.
